        The game is based off the one <a href="http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/">described here</a>.
        <br /><br />
        
        The game is essentially the same as O's and X's except you are playing on 9 boards at once. If you get three in a row on a board before your opponent then you win that board. If you win three boards in a row then you win the game.
        <br /><br />
        
        The clever part is that your move dictates where your opponent goes. If you pick the centre square then your opponent must make a move on the centre board. This means you must consider where you do/don't want your opponent to go when you make your move. There are some caveats to this:
        <br />
        1) If sent to a full board (all 9 squares are filled) then your opponent can move anywhere.<br />
        2) If sent to a completed board (one of you has won it) then your opponent can move anywhere.<br />
